API for Materials Database
==========================

---------------
Materials Database 
---------------
Materials Database is a SQLite3 database with structural and dielectric information of various crystalline materials.

For each material, information is described via a row in database. 
A row can be divided into different groups:
Name, Space Group, Band Gap (exp), Phonon Frequency (max), Dielectric Breakdown Strength Fb (exp), Dielectric Breakdown Strength Fb (ml), Dielectric Constant (tot), Dielectric Constant (ele), Density, Bulk Modulus, Nearest Neighbor Distance
